 ###### These files must exist with exact filenames:
 
 - `public/index/html` is the page template.
 - `src/index.js` is the Javascript entry point.

deleting or renaming other files is exceptable.

- Creat subdirectories inside `src`

- Faster builds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.

- Put any JS and CSS files inside `src`, otherwise Webpack won't see them
