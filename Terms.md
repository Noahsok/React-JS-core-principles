## React Terms 
This is a "dictionary" of sorts 

#### Mounting
- The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM This is called "mounting" in React to match what the components want to be rendered on screen. 
- Mounting is essentially adding nodes to the DOM

#### Unmounting

- Removeing nodes from the DOM and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM)
