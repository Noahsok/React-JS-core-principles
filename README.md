# React-JS-core-principles / Docs
This is a broken down version of [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). 

# this is a WIP, I am a beginner and this is a way for me to lear React. Please keep in mind as this Project grows so will my understanding and skill level. 

#### Concept of "guide"
The concept of this guide is simple. One way I learn is by reading and taking "notes" (when I say "notes" I actually mean rewriting the docs out as I go through them.) 

This guide is my notes and some [CodePen](https://codepen.io/noahsok) projects. 

#### Navigating through this project is probably pretty self explanatory but here is a quick explination. 

- [CodePen Basic Components](https://github.com/Noahsok/React-JS-core-principles/tree/master/CodePen%20Basic%20Components)is where you can see some components I have made to show how to use some core principles. (WIP)

- [Create a New React App](https://github.com/Noahsok/React-JS-core-principles/tree/master/Create%20a%20New%20React%20App) is a small section on ways to create a new React app. (WIP)

- [step-by-step](https://github.com/Noahsok/React-JS-core-principles/tree/master/step-by-step) This is a breakdown of [The React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). (WIP)
