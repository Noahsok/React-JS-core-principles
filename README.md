#### Arrow function expressions

- With arrow functions there are no binding of `this` . In regular functions the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever. With arrow functions the `this` keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

- `=>`
