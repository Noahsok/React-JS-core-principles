Basic notes for React.JS/ JS core principles
## Javascript  Cor Principles

#### Arrow function expressions

- With arrow functions there are no binding of `this` . In regular functions the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever. With arrow functions the `this` keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

- `=>` 

#### Class function

- A JavaScript class is a type of function

#### let statement

- The let statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

#### const

- Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the `let` statement. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
