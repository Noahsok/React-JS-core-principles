# Rendering Elements

###### Elements are the smallest building block of React apps

- an element describes what you want to see on the screen:
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```
- unlike browser DOM elements (P, Div, Table, Etc), React elements are plain objects. They are cheap to create. 

- React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

**Elements are not to be confused with ["components"](https://github.com/Noahsok/React-JS-core-principles/blob/master/step-by-step/a4.%20Components%26Props.md) Elements are what components are "mae of"**
