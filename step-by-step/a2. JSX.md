## JSX

``` const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; ```

- JSX is a XML/HTML-like syntax used by React.

#### why

- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently couple with other UI logic: how events are handled, how state changes, and how data is prepared for display.

- Doesn't seperate technologies by putting logic and markup in seperate files. 

- react seperates programs into distinct sections (seperates concernes) with loosly coupled units called "components" that contain both.

- JSX is not required

#### Embedding Expressions in JSX

###### Example:
```
const name = 'Eric Banner';
```
- Declared a variable called name `Eric Banner`

```
const element = <h1> Hello, {name}</h1>
```
- Used it in JSX by wrapping it in {}

###### Splitting JSX over multiple lines:

- Is not required but can help for readability.

- when doing this wrap it in Parentheses to avoid possible `automatic semicolon insertion`

- You can use JSX inside of `if` statements, `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as argurments, and return it from functions.

#### JSX Specific Attributes

- using quotes to specify `string` literals as attributes
```
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

- using curly braces to embed a Javascript expression in an attribute
```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```
- dont put quotes around curly braces when embedding a Javascript expression in an attribute. use either quotes (for string value) or use curly braces (for expressions) not both in the same attribute.

#### Specific Children with JSX

- close empty tag immediatly with `/>`
```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />
```
- JSX tags may contain children.
```
const element = (
<div>
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>Good to see you.</h2>
</div>
);
```
