## Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

###### conceptually
- components are like Javascript functions

- They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props" short for "properties") and return React elements.
*React elements describe what should appear on the screen*

#### Function and Class Components

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single "props" object argument with data and returns a React element. 
- these are called "function components" because they are literally Javascript functions

###### ES6 classes to define a component:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
These two components are equivalent from React's point of view.

#### Rendering a Component

elements can also represent user-defined components:
```
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />
```
- When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. This object is called "props"

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
Recap:

1. We call `ReactDOM.render()` with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element
2. React calls the `Welcome` `component with {name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
3. Our `Welcome` component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>` element as the result.
4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`.

#### Composing Components

Components can refer to other components in their output. this lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. 

A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

Example, create an `App` component that renders `Welcome` many times:
```
function Welcom(props) {
  return <h1> Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name-"Edite" />
     </div>
  );
}

ReactDom.render(
  <App />
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
Typically, new React apps have a single `App` component at the very top. 
However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like `Button` and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

## Extracting Components

spliting components into smaller components is a good thing.

Example, consider this `Comment` component:
```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
this example accepts `author` (an object), `text` (a string) and `date` (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.

This component con be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. 

###### Extracting components:
- extract avatar:
```
function avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
    src={props.user.avatarUrl}
    alt={props.user.name}
 />
  );
}
```
The `Avatar` doesn't need to know that it is being rendered inside a `comment`. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: `user` rather than `author`.

- Simplify `Comment` a tiny bit:
```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
      {props.author.name}
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="Comment-text">
      {props.text}
    </div>
    <div className="comment-date">
      {formatDate(props.date)}
    </div>
   </div>
  );
}
```

- Next, we will extract a `UserInfo` component that renders an `Avatar` next to the user's name:
```
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
    <Avatar user={props.user} />
    <div className="UserInfo-name">
      {props.user.name}
    </div>
  </div>
  );
}
```

- Simplify `Comment` even further:
```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div class/name=Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formateDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
###### Yes Extracting Components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps.

###### Rule of thumb:
- If a part of your UI is used several times:
- `Button`, `Panel`, `Avatar`
- or is complex enough on its own (`App`, `FeedStory`, `Comment`) it is a good candidate to be a reusable component

#### Props are Read-Only

Whether you declare a component as a funtion or a class, it must never modify its own props. 

```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
This is called a "pure" function because they do not attemt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

in contrast:
```
function withdarw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```
that function is impure because it changes its own input.

Reat is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:
###### all React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. "State" allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else without violating this rule.
